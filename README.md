I'm **Yuvraj**, known professionally as **bufferwise**. Born in Bharat on February 12, 2004, I've established myself as a Full-Stack Developer, UI/UX Designer (Figma), and Discord Community Manager.

# Technical Stack Overview

## Java Development
Spring Boot powers my application development, with Hibernate for database mapping, and JSF/Struts for web frameworks. JavaFX and Vaadin create client interfaces, while JSP and Servlets handle dynamic content. Maven, Gradle, and Ant manage builds and dependencies. Testing uses JUnit, TestNG, Mockito, and Cucumber. Additional tools include Thymeleaf, Handlebars, GraphQL, and RESTEasy. Infrastructure involves Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Docker, and Kubernetes. AI/ML work uses Deep Java Library, TensorFlow Java API, Weka, and DeepLearning4J.

## C++ Development
Poco provides class libraries, Restbed handles REST services, and Crow manages web development. Build systems include CMake, Make, and Ninja. Testing utilizes Google Test, Catch2, and Boost.Test. Web frameworks feature Wt and TreeFrog. ZeroMQ handles messaging, Thrift manages RPC, and Redis++ provides caching. ML tools include dlib, MLpack, OpenCV, and APIs for TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Python Development
Django, Flask, and FastAPI drive backend development, with Jinja2 and Chameleon for templating. Poetry and Pipenv handle dependencies. Testing uses Pytest, UnitTest, Behave, and Hypothesis. Infrastructure includes Gunicorn, Uvicorn, Nginx, and Celery. Databases involve PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka. AI/ML stack features TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, and Hugging Face.

## Web Development
Core technologies include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Frontend frameworks comprise React.js, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte, and Solid.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material-UI. Build tools include Webpack, Vite, and Rollup. Testing uses Jest, Cypress, and Playwright. State management involves Redux, MobX, and Recoil. Backend utilizes Express.js and NestJS. DevOps tools include Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, plus AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud platforms.
